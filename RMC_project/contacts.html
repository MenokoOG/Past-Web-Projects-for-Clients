    <div id="sectone">
      from Henry V by William Shakespeare <br>
      
      This day is called the feast of Crispian:<br>
        He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,<br>
        Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,<br>
        And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
        He that shall live this day, and see old age,<br>
        Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,<br>
        And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'<br>
        Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.<br>
        And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'<br>
        Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,<br>
        But he'll remember with advantages<br>
        What feats he did that day: then shall our names.<br>
        Familiar in his mouth as household words<br>
        Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
        Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,<br>
        Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.<br>
        This story shall the good man teach his son;<br>
        And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,<br>
        From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
        But we in it shall be remember'd;<br>
        We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
        For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br>
        Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
        This day shall gentle his condition:<br>
        And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
        Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,<br>
        And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
        That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
