Military Matters

Welcome to Military Matters with Sergeant J. Hello, my name is Sergeant First Class Lawrence Jefferson II, but in the armed services everyone is pretty much known by their last name; so, I am known as Sergeant Jefferson. You can call me Sergeant (SGT) J. I am part of the wonderful community of Bonners Ferry located in the upper Panhandle of Idaho.

This column serves two purposes. First it is a column to keep the military community of Bonners Ferry informed of various military issues and respond to any issues that the veterans would like to discuss; military matters. Second this column is a window for the non-military citizen to become a little more acquainted with the military and veteran citizens beyond what is normally known; the military does matter. 

I am a United States Army and Army National Guard veteran. I first joined the Army in 1989. I had a three year break in service from 2001 to 2004. During my time in the Army and Army National Guard I have traveled to many different countries and served combat tours in Operation Desert Shield/Storm-Saudi Arabia/Iraq/Kuwait(1990-1991), Operation Iraqi Freedom-Iraq/Kuwait (2004-2005), and Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan (2008-2009). I am by no means an expert on military culture, but I do understand it pretty well since I have been a member of it my entire adult life. 

Before I go any further, I would ask that we take a moment and say thanks to all the service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our country, those service members who have passed on after a honorable service, and to remember those service members who are still missing or are prisoners of war.
